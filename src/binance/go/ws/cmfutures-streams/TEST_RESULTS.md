## Test Symbols Used

### Coin-M Futures Symbols (Updated from COIN-M)
- `btcusd_perp` - Bitcoin USD-denominated perpetual (was btcusdt)
- `ethusd_perp` - Ethereum USD-denominated perpetual (was ethusdt)
- `adausd_perp` - Cardano USD-denominated perpetual (was adausdt)
- `btcusd_current_quarter` - Bitcoin quarterly futures for continuous testing

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
cd src/binance/go/ws/cmfutures-streams

# Run all tests
go test -v

# Run full integration suite
go test -v -run TestFullIntegrationSuite
```

### Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Connection tests
go test -v -run TestConnection

# Stream functionality
go test -v -run TestAggregateTradeStream
go test -v -run TestMarkPriceStream
go test -v -run TestKlineStream

# Combined streams
go test -v -run TestCombinedStream

# Performance tests
go test -v -bench=.
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ Successful Scenarios
- All individual stream subscriptions should work
- Combined stream subscriptions should process multiple event types
- Connection management should handle reconnections gracefully
- Error scenarios should be handled appropriately
- Performance benchmarks should complete within reasonable time

### ⚠️ Expected Testnet Limitations
- **Liquidation Events**: Very rare on testnet (expected 0 events)
- **Composite Index**: Limited availability on testnet
- **Asset Index**: Requires multi-assets mode (may have limited events)

## Test Infrastructure

### Event Handling
- ✅ Automatic event handler registration
- ✅ Event filtering and counting system
- ✅ Concurrent-safe event processing
- ✅ Memory management

### Client Management
- ✅ Shared client pool for efficiency
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on test completion
- ✅ Connection timeout handling
- ✅ Server switching capabilities

## SDK Adaptations Made

### From COIN-M to Coin-M Futures
1. **Import Paths**: Updated from `umfutures-streams` to `cmfutures-streams`
2. **Test Symbols**: Changed from USDT-margined to COIN-margined symbols
3. **Server URLs**: Updated to use `dstream.binancefuture.com` (Coin-M testnet)
4. **Documentation**: Adapted all references to Coin-M futures context

### Files Modified
- All `.go` test files: Updated imports and symbol references
- `README.md`: Adapted for Coin-M futures context
- `API_COVERAGE.md`: Updated stream types and symbols
- `env.example`: Updated for Coin-M futures environment

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Run**: Execute the test suite to verify all adaptations work correctly
2. **Symbol Validation**: Confirm that all Coin-M futures symbols are valid on testnet
3. **Results Update**: Update this file with actual test execution results
4. **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance benchmarks for Coin-M futures

## Notes

- ✅ All test files successfully adapted from cmfutures-streams template
- ✅ Symbol references updated to Coin-M futures format
- ✅ Server URLs updated to Coin-M futures testnet
- ✅ Import paths corrected for cmfutures-streams module
- ⚠️ Tests need to be run to verify complete functionality

## Support

For issues during testing:
1. Verify network connectivity to `dstream.binancefuture.com`
2. Check that Coin-M futures symbols are available on testnet
3. Review logs for specific error messages
4. Consult API_COVERAGE.md for detailed stream information
