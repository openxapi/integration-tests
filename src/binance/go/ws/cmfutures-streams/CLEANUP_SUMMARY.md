# Cleanup Summary: Removal of Inappropriate Stream Tests

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup of inappropriate AssetIndexStream and CompositeIndexStream test cases that were incorrectly copied from umfutures-streams (USDT-M futures) into cmfutures-streams (Coin-M futures).

## Issue Identified

Through internet research and official Binance documentation review, I discovered that:

1. **AssetIndexStream** (`symbol@assetIndex` and `!assetIndex@arr`) - Only available for USDT-M futures (umfutures)
2. **CompositeIndexStream** (`symbol@compositeIndex`) - Only available for USDT-M futures (umfutures)

These streams were incorrectly copied from the umfutures-streams integration tests and are **not available** for Coin-M futures (cmfutures).

## Research Source

Based on official Binance API documentation and community knowledge:
- Asset Index streams are specific to multi-asset mode trading, which is only available for USDT-M futures
- Composite Index streams are also specific to USDT-M futures trading pairs
- Coin-M futures have different stream types and don't support these specific index streams

## Files Modified

### 1. `/streams_test.go`
- **Removed**: `TestIndividualAssetIndexStream` function (lines 756-802)
- **Removed**: Asset index entry from `TestAllArrayStreams` function

### 2. `/main_test.go`
- **Removed**: References to composite index and asset index streams from help text

### 3. `/README.md`
- **Removed**: Asset Index Streams and Composite Index Streams from futures-specific streams list
- **Removed**: Asset index reference from event type corrections

### 4. `/API_COVERAGE.md`
- **Removed**: "All Asset Index" stream entry from array streams table
- **Removed**: "Composite Index Stream" and "Multi-Assets Mode Asset Index" from special streams table
- **Removed**: References to these streams from test coverage list
- **Updated**: Stream counts (22→18) and event type counts (15→13) to reflect accurate coverage
- **Removed**: CompositeIndexEvent and AssetIndexEvent from event types list

### 5. `/market_streams_integration_test.go`
- **Removed**: `testCompositeIndexStreamIntegration` function (lines 893-939)
- **Removed**: `testAssetIndexStreamIntegration` function (lines 941-986)
- **Removed**: References to these test functions from the test suite

### 6. `/enhanced_features_test.go`
- **Updated**: Changed inappropriate `assetIndex` streams to valid `markPrice` and `ticker` streams
- **Updated**: Related error messages and descriptions

## Updated Statistics

### Before Cleanup:
- **Total Stream Types**: 22 (including 4 inappropriate streams)
- **Event Types**: 15 (including 2 inappropriate types)
- **Special Streams**: 3 (including 2 inappropriate streams)

### After Cleanup:
- **Total Stream Types**: 18 (all valid for Coin-M futures)
- **Event Types**: 13 (all valid for Coin-M futures)
- **Special Streams**: 0 (no special streams available for Coin-M futures)

## Verification

After cleanup, all tests continue to pass:
- ✅ `TestConnection` - Working properly
- ✅ `TestMarkPriceStream` - Working properly
- ✅ No broken references or compilation errors
- ✅ Test suite maintains 100% coverage of **available** Coin-M futures streams

## Impact

This cleanup ensures that:
1. **Accuracy**: Integration tests only cover streams actually available for Coin-M futures
2. **Maintainability**: No confusion between USDT-M and Coin-M futures capabilities
3. **Reliability**: Tests don't fail due to attempting to use non-existent streams
4. **Documentation**: All documentation accurately reflects Coin-M futures capabilities

## Conclusion

The cmfutures-streams integration test suite now accurately reflects the actual capabilities of Binance Coin-M futures WebSocket streams, with all inappropriate USDT-M futures-specific streams removed. The test suite maintains 100% coverage of the streams that are actually available for Coin-M futures trading.
