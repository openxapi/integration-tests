# Binance CMFUTURES WebSocket API Coverage

This document tracks the implementation coverage of integration tests for the Binance CMFUTURES WebSocket SDK.

## API Coverage Summary

**Total APIs**: 10
**Covered**: 10 (100%)
**Remaining**: 0 (0%)

## API List and Coverage Status

### Account APIs (USER_DATA Authentication Required)
- [x] `account.balance` - Get account balance information
- [x] `account.position` - Get account position information  
- [x] `account.status` - Get account trading status

### Trading APIs (TRADE Authentication Required)
- [x] `order.place` - Place a new order
- [x] `order.modify` - Modify an existing order
- [x] `order.cancel` - Cancel an order
- [x] `order.status` - Get order status (USER_DATA auth)

### User Data Stream APIs (USER_STREAM Authentication Required)
- [x] `userDataStream.start` - Start a user data stream
- [x] `userDataStream.ping` - Keep user data stream alive
- [x] `userDataStream.stop` - Stop the user data stream

## Test Files Coverage

| Test File | APIs Covered | Count |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| account_test.go | account.balance, account.position, account.status | 3 |
| trading_test.go | order.place, order.modify, order.cancel, order.status | 4 |
| userdata_test.go | userDataStream.start, userDataStream.ping, userDataStream.stop, account.balance, account.position, account.status | 6 |
| **Total** | **All APIs** | **10** |

## Notes

- The CMFUTURES WebSocket SDK does not include public data APIs (depth, ticker, etc.) unlike SPOT and UMFUTURES
- All APIs require authentication (no public endpoints)
- User Data Stream events are handled through event handlers, not request/response pattern

## Progress Tracking

Last Updated: 2025-07-13

### Completed:
1. ✅ Created initial project structure (go.mod, env.example, README.md, main_test.go)
2. ✅ Implemented account API tests (account.balance, account.position, account.status)
3. ✅ Implemented trading API tests (order.place, order.modify, order.cancel, order.status)
4. ✅ Implemented user data stream tests (start, ping, stop)
5. ✅ Enhanced user data stream tests with account query operations
6. ✅ Created comprehensive integration test suite

### Test Features:
- Full error handling with detailed API error reporting
- Rate limiting between API calls
- Comprehensive test cleanup (order cancellation, stream stopping)
- Verbose logging option for debugging
- Test helpers for common operations
- Complete workflow testing in integration suite
- User data stream lifecycle testing with account operations
- Comprehensive user data flow testing combining streams and account queries
